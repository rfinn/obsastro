    "To use the CCD, turn on the laptop provided and run the CCDOps program. If you are working with a your own laptop (only recommended if you have a mac), you will need to first install CCDOps Lite and the Universal Binary SBIG Driver Installer on one of the mac laptops. The software is available for free from SBIG (http://www.sbig.com/Software.html).\n",

    "The **Grab** command is what actually acquires an image. The read noise and dark count can be obtained no matter what the camera is looking at (note that our device has a minimum exposure time of 0.12 seconds). To get flat frames or actual pictures, though, you will have to give the camera something to image. Flat frames require something with uniform illumination (what would be good?). To be useful at correcting telescope images, the Flat Frames must themselves be taken with the telescope; in this lab we are just trying to quantify what the pixel-to-pixel variations are.\n",

    "We are going to start with the camera by itself. You may want to use one of the filters that is installed in the color wheel to reduce the amount of light falling on the CCD. By pressing Cntl-#, you can rotate the wheel to a specific filter. Check for yourself what filter corresponds to each number. (Note: the filters have coatings, so their reflected color is not a good indication of what they transmit. Be sure to look through the filters to determine which is what.) If you have already covered the camera aperture and canâ€™t see the filter wheel anymore, be sure to LISTEN to be certain the wheel is turning when you want it to.\n",
